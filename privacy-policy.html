              precautions to protect information consisting of Personal
              information and `Sensitive Personal Data or Information' (SPDI)
              ("Information") of visitors of the ftvvodka and comply with all
              legal, regulatory and/or contractual obligations related to
              privacy. FashionTV has adopted the "Privacy by Default" principles
              in its approach to data privacy, i.e., the privacy of data and
              information is upheld first by default. This policy covers the
              processing, storage, and access to information as required under
              lawful and/or contractual activities with FashionTV or otherwise
              required in the normal course of business.

              It describes FashionTV's policies and procedures on the collection, usage, and disclosure of information provided/received by natural persons and meets the requirements established under:

            <h1>Scope</h1>
            <p>
              This policy applies to all visitors to FashionTV's ftvvodka.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Information covered by this Policy <br />
              This policy applies to information collected and processed by
              FashionTV consisting of the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              2.1 Personal information is information related to a visitor or a
              combination of pieces of information that could reasonably allow
              him to be identified. Personal information may consist of Full
              Name, Date of Birth, Age, Current City, Birth City, Mobile Number,
              Email ID, Social Media Handles like Facebook, Instagram, and
              Twitter, Marital Status, Passport Details, and photo images. While
              information such as date of birth in isolation may not be enough
              to identify the visitor uniquely, a combination of full name and
              date of birth may be sufficient to do so. The Personal Information
              will be used for the internal processes of the FashionTV
              ftvvodka, such as the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Screening and Selection process of the participants.</li>
              <li>
                To recognize a unique anonymous user and enhance its user
                experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                To communicate and notify you about FashionTV's latest updates,
                offers, events, etc.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              2.2 Sensitive personal data or information ("SPDI") is such
              personal information that is collected, received, stored,
